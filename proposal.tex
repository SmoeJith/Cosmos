    \section{Purpose}
    \paragraph{This web application will act as a social forum for short form discourse among users on the platform. Short form discourse will take place through ``comets," public messages consisting of at most 250 characters and a single accompanying image, and reactions. This content is entirely user generated and stored in a database.}
    
    \section{Project Title}
    \paragraph{This project will be called Cosmos. This reflects our vision of creating a space where people can communicate openly via brief messages across vast distances.}

    \section{Database/Model Design}
    \paragraph{The back-end of the web application will interact with a database of four tables. The first table would be for storing users, and authentication specific to said users. The second table would store posts, a post being classified as either a comet or a reply. The third table would be for storing follows between users. Finally, the fourth table would hold reactions to posts by users. Defined below are the expected fields for each type of table:}

    \section{Work Plan}
    \paragraph{There will be at least one weekly in person meeting occurring at 4:00 PM on Fridays. This does not include weekend work sessions conducted remotely. This project will utilize a modified Git Flow organizational style for the repository, and so after the first few commits to the repository modifications to the project will occur primarily through feature branches off of the main branch. As the team consists of only two people and the project will only need to be presented a single time, the additional project organizational complexity that full implementation of Git Flow requires is deemed unnecessary at this time.}
