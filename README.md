# Cosmos
Cosmos is a social network and social media web application built using Django, Bootstrap, and jQuery.

This project was originally my final project for Dr. Yusuf Albayram's CS416: Web Programming course at CCSU, but after the semester ended I felt as if I wanted to continue working on it.
